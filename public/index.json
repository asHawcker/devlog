[{"content":"\rHome/Projects/JudgeME/Journey - JudgeME | Day 1\rJourney\rDay 1\rThe Initial Idea\rI had this Idea from a youtube video I saw and I thought it would be fun to make and use. I also realised that this process is on the simpler side and I already had some Idea on how I would go about implementing this project.\nI started with looking into what tools would be necessary and suitable for implementing the idea I had. I also wanted to follow an organised folder structure and organise the code into different files depending upon the functionality.\nI did take the help of AI tools to decide on what things should be in what file and what conventions should I follow to write good readable code.\nSetting up the Github API\rThis was my first time using to the Oauth feature of Github. I set-up the Oauth app and then created the routes to call this API and then generating a JWT to save this info so I do not have to route requests to github to authorise everytime the LogIn button is clicked.\nThis reduces the constant need to call github and also saves up time of repeated users. I also learned how passport-gihub made this so much easy. I proceeded with setting up the GeminiAPI and a minimal frontend to test the API. I spend some time testing out different prompts to find what works best.\nOne thing that helped was increasing the temperature of the model from 1 to 1.2. This allowed the model to be a little more \u0026ldquo;creative\u0026rdquo;, which was good for the quircky response that I was expecting the model to produce. Frontend\rI now upgraded the frontend and I decided to go with a dark neon-ish Arch linux inspired theme.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/judgeme/journey-d1/","title":"Journey - JudgeME | Day 1"},{"content":"\rHome/Projects/JudgeME/Journey - JudgeME | Day 2\rJourney\rDay 2\rSetting up Chess.com\rThis was simpler than Github as no login was required here and since the entire workflow was set-up. Things went on pretty smooth. Just simple api request to fetch the user data and the gemini API worked the same.\nProblem with frontend: The frontend I made previously was not very extensible to there were a few issue to adjust it to support Chess.com judging. But I chagned it up to fit everything perfectly and to also keep it extensible for when I add new other platforms. Setting up leetcode\rI tried to include Spotify but the spotify dev platform is not allowing new app creations for sometime now so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t proceed with that. I decided to add leetcode instead. Again the process was repititive.\nMade up a different frontend feature to display the problem difficulty count to suite the theme better and to make better use of the API data recieved.
