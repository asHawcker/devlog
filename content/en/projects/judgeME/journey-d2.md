# Journey

## Day 2

### Setting up Chess.com

This was simpler than Github as no login was required here and since the entire workflow was set-up. Things went on pretty smooth.
Just simple api request to fetch the user data and the gemini API worked the same.

- **Problem with frontend**: The frontend I made previously was not very extensible to there were a few issue to adjust it to support Chess.com judging. But I chagned it up to fit everything perfectly and to also keep it extensible for when I add new other platforms.

### Setting up leetcode

I tried to include Spotify but the spotify dev platform is not allowing new app creations for sometime now so I couldn't proceed with that. I decided to add leetcode instead. Again the process was repititive.

- Made up a different frontend feature to display the problem difficulty count to suite the theme better and to make better use of the API data recieved.
